yarn add @carbon/grid

we install above carbon package because we
want to layout our pages with grid. I'm
assuming the css grid customized by carbon
in some way.

the carbon grid has default column on 12
$feature-flags: (
  ui-shell: true,
  grid-columns-16: true,
);


above is used to configure grid to have
16-columns
